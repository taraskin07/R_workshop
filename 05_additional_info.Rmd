# Chapter 05: Using vectors and apply functions to speed up the process.

## 5 Difference between loops and vector operations

```{r}
# Set up a large numeric vector
set.seed(123)
large_vector <- runif(1e7)  # 10 million random numbers

# Method 1: Using a for loop
system.time({
  squared_loop <- numeric(length(large_vector))
  for (i in seq_along(large_vector)) {
    squared_loop[i] <- large_vector[i]^2
  }
})

# Method 2: Using vectorized operation
system.time({
  squared_vectorized <- large_vector^2
})


# Compare results (should be identical)
all.equal(squared_loop, squared_vectorized)
```



### Conclusion

Use vectors and vector operations - they are faster!
