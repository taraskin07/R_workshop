# Chapter 06: Descriptive Statistics: Mean, median, standard deviation, and summary statistics.

```{r}
# Load the built-in dataset

Descriptive statistics refers to a set of techniques and methods used to
summarize, organize, and present data in a meaningful way. It provides a
simple and informative overview of a dataset, allowing researchers and
analysts to understand the key characteristics of the data without
delving into complex statistical analyses.

Key Components of Descriptive Statistics

```         
Measures of Central Tendency:
    Mean: The average of a set of values, calculated by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.
    Median: The middle value in a dataset when the values are sorted in ascending order. It divides the dataset into two equal halves.
    Mode: The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

Measures of Dispersion (Variation):
    Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset, indicating the spread of values.
    Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean, providing a measure of how much the values deviate from the mean.
    Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, indicating the average distance of each data point from the mean. It provides a clearer sense of dispersion since it is in the same units as the data.

Shape of the Distribution:
    Skewness: A measure of the asymmetry of the data distribution. A positive skew indicates a longer tail on the right side, while a negative skew indicates a longer tail on the left side.
    Kurtosis: A measure of the "tailedness" of the data distribution, indicating whether the data has heavy or light tails compared to a normal distribution.

Summary Statistics:
    Minimum and Maximum: The smallest and largest values in the dataset.
    Quartiles: Values that divide the dataset into four equal parts, with the first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), and third quartile (Q3) being particularly important for understanding the spread and center of the data.
    Interquartile Range (IQR): The range between the first and third quartiles (Q3 - Q1), representing the middle 50% of the data.
    
```

## 6.1 Measures of Central Tendency

### 6.1.1 Mean

Mean: The average of a set of values, calculated by summing all the
values and dividing by the number of values.

```{r}
integers <- c(4, 3, 4, 4, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4, 4)
mean(integers)
```

```{r}
barplot(table(integers))
```

```{r}
hist(integers, breaks = length(unique(integers)))
```

Is it useful to find mean value for our dataset?

```{r}
mean(dataset$len)
```

Let's load "dplyr" and filter it out

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
dose_1mg <- dataset %>% 
  filter(dose == 1) %>% 
  filter(supp == "OJ")
```

```{r}
table(dose_1mg)
```

```{r}
mean(dose_1mg$len)
```

In "dplyr" we can find all mean values for all groups at the same time

```{r}
dose_1mg_summary <- dataset %>% 
  filter(dose == 1) %>% 
  filter(supp == "OJ") %>% 
  summarise(mean_len = mean(len))
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dataset %>%
  group_by(dose, supp) %>%
  summarise(mean_len = mean(len))
```

What do we do when we group our data by columns

```{r}
dataset %>%
  group_by(dose, supp)
```

If we take a closer look, we'll see that actually the mean value is the
least frequent

```{r}
hist(dose_1mg$len)
```

### 6.1.2 Median

Median: The middle value in a dataset when the values are sorted in
ascending order. It divides the dataset into two equal halves.

```{r}
median(dose_1mg$len)
```

```{r}
median(integers)
```

Comparing both mean and median

```{r}
dataset %>% 
  group_by(dose, supp) %>% 
  summarise(average = mean(len), 
            median = median(len))
```

```{r}
# For instance fish length in a lake
skewed <- c(13, 15, 14, 16, 14, 15, 14, 13, 12, 7, 9, 10, 900, 789, 670)
```

```{r}
hist(skewed)
```

What is the mean and median value here?

```{r}
mean(skewed)
```

```{r}
median(skewed)
```

### 6.1.3 Mode

Mode: The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

The mtcars dataset is a built-in dataset in R that contains information
about various models of cars from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine.

Data Frame Structure: The dataset is a data frame with 32 rows
(representing different car models) and 11 columns (representing various
attributes of the cars). Variables (Columns):

```         
mpg: Miles per gallon (fuel efficiency)
cyl: Number of cylinders in the engine
disp: Displacement (in cubic inches)
hp: Horsepower
drat: Rear axle ratio
wt: Weight (in thousands of pounds)
qsec: 1/4 mile time (time taken to cover a quarter mile)
vs: Engine type (0 = V/S, 1 = straight)
am: Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
gear: Number of forward gears
carb: Number of carburetors
```

```{r}
data("mtcars")
```

```         
am: Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
```

What is the most popular transmission?

```{r}
# Mode calculation here performed without the use of any built-in functions =(
transmission <- mtcars %>%
                group_by(am) %>%             
                summarise(count = n()) %>%    
                filter(count == max(count)) %>%
                pull(am) 

if (transmission == 0) {print("automatic")} else {print("manual")}
```

## 6.2 Measures of Dispersion (Variation)

### 6.2.1 Range

Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a
dataset, indicating the spread of values.

```{r}
# reframe == summarise but for one column 
mtcars %>%
  reframe(range_mpg = range(mpg))
```

```{r}
range(skewed)
```

### 6.2.2 Variance

Variance: The average of the squared differences from the mean,
providing a measure of how much the values deviate from the mean.

![Variance](pictures/variance.jpeg)

```{r}
dataset %>% 
  group_by(dose, supp) %>% 
  summarise(variance = var(len),
            average = mean(len),
            median = median(len), 
            range = range(len))
```

### 6.2.3 Standard Deviation

Standard Deviation: The square root of the variance, indicating the
average distance of each data point from the mean. It provides a clearer
sense of dispersion since it is in the same units as the data.

![Variance](pictures/sd.jpg)

```{r}
dataset %>% 
  group_by(dose, supp) %>% 
  summarise(variance = var(len),
            sd = sd(len),
            average = mean(len),
            median = median(len), 
            range = range(len))
```

### 6.2.4 Coefficient of variation (CV)

The coefficient of variation (CV) is a standardized measure of
dispersion of a probability distribution or frequency distribution. It
is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation (SD) to the mean
(average) and is often expressed as a percentage. The coefficient of
variation is useful for comparing the relative variability of data sets
that may have different units or different means.

![Variance](pictures/cv.jpg)

```{r}
dataset %>% 
  group_by(dose, supp) %>% 
  summarise(variance = var(len),
            sd = sd(len),
            average = mean(len),
            cv = round(sd(len)/mean(len)*100, 1)) %>%
  mutate(cv = paste0(cv, "%"))
```

## 6.3 Shape of the Distribution

Skewness: A measure of the asymmetry of the data distribution. A positive skew indicates a longer tail on the right side, while a negative skew indicates a longer tail on the left side. 

Kurtosis: A measure of the "tailedness" of the data distribution, indicating whether the data has heavy or light tails compared to a normal distribution.

Functions to calcuate such parameters are located in the package "moments"

```{r}
install.packages("moments")
```

```{r}
library(moments)
```

ToothGrowth dataset, dose 1 mg

```{r}
hist(dose_1mg$len)
```

```{r}
# Calculate skewness
mpg_skewness <- skewness(dose_1mg$len)

# Calculate kurtosis
mpg_kurtosis <- kurtosis(dose_1mg$len)

# Print the results
print(paste("Skewenes (-3:3):", round(mpg_skewness, 2)))
print(paste("Kurtosis (-2:10):", round(mpg_kurtosis, 2)))

```

mtcars dataset

```{r}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r}
# Calculate skewness
mpg_skewness <- skewness(mtcars$mpg)

# Calculate kurtosis
mpg_kurtosis <- kurtosis(mtcars$mpg)

# Print the results
print(paste("Skewenes (-3:3):", round(mpg_skewness, 2)))
print(paste("Kurtosis (-2:10):", round(mpg_kurtosis, 2)))

```

skewed vector

```{r}
barplot(table(skewed))
```

```{r}
hist(skewed, breaks = length(unique(skewed)))
```

```{r}
# Calculate skewness
mpg_skewness <- skewness(skewed)

# Calculate kurtosis
mpg_kurtosis <- kurtosis(skewed)

# Print the results
print(paste("Skewenes (-3:3):", round(mpg_skewness, 2)))
print(paste("Kurtosis (-2:10):", round(mpg_kurtosis, 2)))

```

## 6.4 Summary Statistics

### 6.4.1 Minimum and Maximum: The smallest and largest values in the dataset.

```{r}
max(dataset$len)
min(dataset$len)
```

### 6.4.2 Quartiles.

Values that divide the dataset into four equal parts, with
the first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), and third quartile (Q3) being
particularly important for understanding the spread and center of the
data.

```{r}
dataset %>% 
  group_by(dose, supp) %>% 
  summarise(
    Q1 = quantile(len, 0.25),
    Q2 = quantile(len, 0.5),
    median = median(len),
    Q3 = quantile(len, 0.75)
  )
```

```{r}
skewed_even <- c(13, skewed)
sort(skewed_even)
quantile(skewed_even, 0.25)
```

### 6.4.3 Interquartile Range (IQR)

The range between the first and third quartiles (Q3 - Q1), representing the middle 50% of the data.

Built-in function

```{r}
IQR(skewed_even)
```

IQR is a difference between Q3 and Q1

```{r}
quantile(skewed_even, 0.75) - quantile(skewed_even, 0.25)
```

Outliers detection

![outliers](pictures/outliers.jpg)

```{r}
skewed_even
Q1 <- quantile(skewed_even, 0.25)
Q3 <- quantile(skewed_even, 0.75)
IQR <- IQR(skewed_even)
lower_threshold <- Q1-1.5*IQR
upper_threshold <- Q3+1.5*IQR
```

```{r}
skewed_even[skewed_even > lower_threshold & skewed_even < upper_threshold]
```

For representation purposes let's change extreme values to more close to others

```{r}
skewed_altered <- skewed_even
skewed_altered[14] <- 35
skewed_altered[15] <- 29
skewed_altered[16] <- 26
```

Boxplot

```{r}
boxplot(skewed_altered, 
        main = "Boxplot of skewed_even Values", 
        ylab = "Values", 
        col = "lightblue", 
        outline = TRUE)

# Add lines for Q1, Q3, and thresholds
abline(h = Q1, col = "red", lty = 2)  # Q1
abline(h = Q3, col = "blue", lty = 2)  # Q3
abline(h = lower_threshold, col = "orange", lty = 2)  # Lower threshold
abline(h = upper_threshold, col = "orange", lty = 2)  # Upper threshold

# Identify outliers
outliers <- skewed_altered[skewed_altered < lower_threshold | skewed_altered > upper_threshold]

# Add text labels for outliers
if (length(outliers) > 0) {
    text(x = rep(1.1, length(outliers)), y = outliers, labels = outliers, pos = 4, col = "red")
}
```
### 6.4.4 Built-in summary table

```{r}
summary(skewed_altered)
```


### Conclusion

In this chapter we discussed basic concepts of descriptive statistics: main measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, distribution shape and basic summary statistics. It is needed to provide a simple and informative overview of a dataset, allowing researchers and analysts to understand the key characteristics of the data without delving into complex statistical analyses.
